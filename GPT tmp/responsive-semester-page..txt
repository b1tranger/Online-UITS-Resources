Key changes I made to fix the mobile responsiveness:

Added a viewport meta tag for proper mobile scaling
Replaced the table layout with CSS Grid using grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr))
Used min() function for responsive widths that work on all screen sizes
Simplified the HTML structure and removed unnecessary nested tables
Removed redundant align attributes and replaced with CSS text-align
Made the container and spacing more responsive with percentage-based widths
Improved typography and spacing for better readability
Streamlined the CSS classes and reduced redundancy

The page will now:

Display in a single column on mobile devices
Maintain consistent spacing and padding
Be more readable and accessible
Scale properly across all device sizes
