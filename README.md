For now it's just a Google Drive Folder containing all necessary resources throughout BSc in CSE Program in UITS.
Although, under UGC, many of the resources can be found being common in many other universities.

I plan to make a website which can host all of these independent of Google Ecosystem. It's a huge project, and decided on my own accord. Meaning it's unofficial and not officially affiliated with UITS. (Even though I tried to make it official, but meh ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ ) 

I hope this helps many others at least to find their needs a bit more organized. Good Luck!
